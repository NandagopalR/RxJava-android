# RxJava-android

This project is intented for every Android developer who is interested in Rx extension for Java language.

Covered fields:
 * how to combine Rx extension and Android UI - Button/EditText/Switch etc.
 * how to combine Rx extension and RetroFit
 * how to combine Rx extension and Firebase
 * how to write your own Observables
 * how to do more complex operations with map functions - filters/maps etc.
 * usage of method references
 * **every sample is written in both classic RxAndroid and in modern lambda manner**


Usage
=====

Since we use [Gradle Retrolambda Plugin](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda) you have to have [jdk8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your computer.

Other than that, you should be ready to go. Just clone the repo and have fun!


Contribution
============

I will be more than happy if you want to contribute/fork this repo so we can provide more knowledge to our other colleagues.

Since there is no comprehensive tutorial on RxJava/RxAndroid/RetroLambda (in one place), at least what I am aware of, it would be great to include as much as possible code examples. Please, have on mind that I would like to always have code examples for both RxAndroid and lambda way.
